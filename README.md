<h1>hacScheduler Challenge!</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
  <p> Dealing with express.js node, npm packages this has taught me a lot about get/post/delete requests! Working with the backend and making API has been fun thus far!</p>


  <ul>
    <li>First I formated the file structure.</li>
    <li>Then I've downloaded the required NPM packages and required them in files.</li>
    <li>Then i've used express.js middleware to enable data parsing</li>
    <li>Then I've used get requests to link html files.</li>
    <li>Utilizing insomnia to check the get routes to ensure they were working. </li>
    <li>Then I've made get/post/delete api requests</li>
    <li>Once again utilizing insomnia to check the get/post/delete request to ensure everything is being assigned a unique id and deleting.</li>
    <li>I've also made a routing folder and required the routes in server.js! Neato.</li>
  </ul>
